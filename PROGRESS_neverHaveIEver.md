## 📝 Notes
### Game Rules Implemented
Based on research, the traditional "Never Have I Ever" game involves:
1. Players sit in a circle
2. One player states something they've never done
3. Players who HAVE done it drink/put finger down
4. Game continues around the circle
5. Last player with fingers up (or least drinks) wins

### Our Enhanced Version
- Added guessing mechanic: players guess who wrote each statement
- Dual scoring: traditional drink tracking + guessing accuracy points
- Anonymous statement submission to prevent bias
- Real-time leaderboards visible to all players
- Support for 2-4 players with room-based multiplayer

### Technical Decisions
- Using WebSockets for real-time updates instead of polling
- In-memory storage for MVP (can scale to Redis later)
- React 19 with latest TypeScript features
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, modern design
- Bun runtime for high-performance backend

### Implementation Progress
✅ **Completed Core Infrastructure:**
- Backend WebSocket server with Bun
- Game state management and room system
