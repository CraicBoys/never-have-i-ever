## 📝 Notes
### Game Rules Implemented
Based on research, the traditional "Never Have I Ever" game involves:
1. Players sit in a circle
2. One player states something they've never done
3. Players who HAVE done it drink/put finger down
4. Game continues around the circle
5. Last player with fingers up (or least drinks) wins

### Our Enhanced Version
- Added guessing mechanic: players guess who wrote each statement
- Dual scoring: traditional drink tracking + guessing accuracy points
- Anonymous statement submission to prevent bias
- Real-time leaderboards visible to all players
- Support for 2-4 players with room-based multiplayer

### Technical Decisions
- Using WebSockets for real-time updates instead of polling
- In-memory storage for MVP (can scale to Redis later)
- React 19 with latest TypeScript features
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, modern design
- Bun runtime for high-performance backend

### Implementation Progress
✅ **Completed Core Infrastructure:**
- Backend WebSocket server with Bun
- Game state management and room system
- Frontend lobby and waiting room
- Real-time player connections
- Room code generation and joining

🔄 **Currently Working On:**
- Statement submission phase
- Guessing mechanics
- Drinking phase interface
- Final results display

## 📅 Timeline Updates

- **Development Start**: Pending - ready to begin implementation
- **Target Completion**: 4 weeks from development start

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Set up WebSocket server infrastructure
2. Create basic game room management
3. Implement frontend lobby and joining flow
4. Build statement submission system
5. Add guessing and scoring mechanics
6. Integrate real-time updates and leaderboards
7. Testing and polish phase
